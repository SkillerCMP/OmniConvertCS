## OmniconvertCS (C → C# Conversion)

**OmniconvertCS** is a C# port of **Omniconvert 1.1.1R** with additional quality-of-life features and helpers.

This is *not* meant to take away from anyone who built standalone editors over the years; Omniconvert itself was already a huge community effort that pulled together:

- Public research on device formats and crypt routines  
- New reversing work to fill in the missing pieces  
- A unified tool that made PS2 cheat formats actually manageable

> Pyriel was always someone I looked up to and is one of the reasons I was even able to do what I do now.  
> Converting Omniconvert into C# has been a fun challenge and an honor — I never thought I’d be porting something this complex.  
> Big thanks to everyone who contributed to the PS2 scene back in the day and keeps it alive now. ❤️
